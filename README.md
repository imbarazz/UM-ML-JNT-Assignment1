## Summary
A demo project predicting the fatalities of an aircraft flight crash by comparing 3 individual Machine Learning techniques:

* Isolation Forest
* Support Vector Regression
* KNN

## Usage
This application will be run as a website which will instruct the user to:
1. select a technique from the dropdown 
2. input the flight details
3. submit to view prediction

## Disclaimer
The purpose of this effort is **strictly** to showcase the strenghts and weaknesses amongst the 3 techniques used, and **by no means claims any sort of accuracy in its predictions**.
